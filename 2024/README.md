# Advent of Code 2024

As I am trying to learn Go, I figured this would be a fun and productive way to learn how to use Go without having to follow a guide or spend time reading a book, which I have found to be not so efficient for learning a new language!

While working on these daily problems, my goals are:
 - To have fun while solving challenging problems!
 - To learn more about Go and its perks and nuances
 - To build efficient solutions
